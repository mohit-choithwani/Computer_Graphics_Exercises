 In flat shading, the visible specular highlight in the middle appears on the entire polygon. Hence,
 the result is single flat color for every polygon.
 In Gouraud shading, the visible specular highlight in the middle appears on the vertex. and interpolates them
 over a polygon.
 
 In Phong shading, you get smooth specular highlights because it interpolates the lighting parameters
 across the polygon and computes the lighting per fragment, not per vertex
